Title: Highway Number Identifier

This project identifies U.S. interstate highways based on their numbering system. Primary highways, numbered 1-99, are classified as north/south (odd numbers) or east/west (even numbers). Auxiliary highways, numbered 100-999, serve primary highways indicated by the rightmost two digits. The program determines whether a given highway number is primary or auxiliary and provides additional details, including the primary highway it serves and its directional orientation.
